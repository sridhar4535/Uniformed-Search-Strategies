Water Management of a City with Antique Plumbing System using Uninformed Search Strategies:

->The problem statement was to find the shortest and the least cost path for water to traverse from one part of the city to another.
->One strange fact about this city is that some of the pipes which are old do not function in specific times. So the route would be different
at different times. But if water is already flowing in a pipe, it will continue flowing even if time reaches one of those periods. You just
have to make sure that when you want to select the next pipe for the rest of your water route, it is in its working time.
->Developed an algorithm in Java based on uniformed search strategies to solve this problem.
